## Guide how to config the TypeScript

### Install the TypeScript

- Download and Install [Node.js] with the LTS version by the link below
(https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- In the command line run `npm install -g typescript`
Note: "typescript" needs to be all lowercase.

### Compiling TypeScript
To compile the TypeScript files with the watch option, you can use this command in your terminal:
`tsc --watch`
The `--watch` flag tells TypeScript to keep watching for changes on any file that ends with `.ts`. When it detects a change, it will auto-generate the javascript files.

The `--watch` option command line only requires running one time whenever the project is open.
